## Building webrtc static library
This is a quite error-prune and cumbersome endevour. Thus, it is recommended to use the Dockerfile
that comes with this project `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` and either run a build in VScode Devcontainer
or run it with plain docker.

You may have to increase the may container size in docker daemon.
